# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## My Project
Welcome to my BMI Calculator project, where I explored the art of customizing Flutter Widgets to bring unique and captivating user interfaces to life. This project enabled me to transform unconventional designs into reality using the power of Flutter.

## What I Created
In this endeavor, I proudly present a Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator, drawing inspiration from the captivating designs by Ruben Vaalt. The app is a multi-screen marvel, offering straightforward functionality while showcasing a richly customized aesthetic.

## What I Learned
Throughout this journey, I gained a wealth of knowledge, including:

- The utilization of Flutter themes for maintaining a consistent brand identity.
- Crafting multi-page apps through Flutter Routes and Navigator.
- The ability to effortlessly extract and refactor Flutter Widgets.
- Leveraging function passing as parameters and fields for dynamic functionality.
- Utilizing the GestureDetector Widget to detect various gestures, going beyond mere taps.
- Creating custom color palettes with hex codes to achieve unique aesthetics.
- Mastering the art of customizing Flutter Widgets to realize precise design styles.
- Understanding Dart Enums and the Ternary Operator for elegant code.
- Embracing the concept of composition over inheritance, in line with Flutter's approach to custom UI.
- Distinguishing between const and final in Dart and applying them effectively.

This project is not merely an app; it's a testament to my versatility as a Flutter developer. I am now well-prepared to breathe life into any design vision using Flutter's robust toolkit! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨ðŸ“±
